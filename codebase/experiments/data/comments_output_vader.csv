I don't care what kind of job Joe Biden has done. It no way in would I would vote for Donald  Duck Trump . I wouldn't dare vote for any person that cause people to die behind a lie he cause on January 6th or a person that's talking about becoming a dictator.  JOE BIDEN 2024.;neu
#FailingAmerica: @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe is failing to secure our Borders, Inflation is still high, Failing The Next Generation when it comes to education, Crime is skyrocketing, Foreign Policy is a mess on his watch, Middle East conflict. America 🇺🇸 needs new leadership.;neu

"It is wrong that two branches of our government appear to be controlled by one sex offender under indictment for insurrection and theft of classified documents who is giving the orders to his cult followers to ""shut down"" the government for nine months.  How did a once strong nation come to this?  Trump won the NH primary, but if there is justice in the United States he will vanish before next November and be behind bars.";neu

"TRUMP'S = HATRED & JEALOUSY = 2024 !!
Hatred has plagued man since we wore skins of fur
Beating our enemies with stick and stone.
History has proven what we refuse to learn
As the seeds of hate by dispute are sown.

It's a fact, hate has been caused by religion
Or by those of different pigment of skin.
It's also a fact it's mostly jealousy
Mixed with the stupidity of sin.

If hatred consumes you refuse it control
For only then can you begin to live.
We don't have to remain wicked and spiteful
We just have to be willing to forgive.

Our riches can certainly grow their own wings
Though it's love that keeps us happy not things.
When we become rich beyond our wildest dreams
That's when hate always pursues us it seems.

So 47% of registered republicans in NH either voted against Trump or stayed home. Pretty lame showing. No wonder Nikki scares him.;neu
Of course they infiltrated like commumist, because they are. Russia selling cheap oil to china, instead to europe and us, is the biggest thing biden did.;neu

Ppl are celebrating trump now ,especially his plan to send ppl back home,I think this is a blessing to the ppl that cross the boarder and immigrant, cause what Russia have plans for this country ,it will be worse than 9 11,so congrats mr trump,do God's work send them home,all of us home,u doing God's work;neu

Voters wont elect a manic;neu
And Biden will lose as well.;neu
Hey Nikki you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Nikki, hey Nikki! I don't know why Trump was complaining that Nikki was acting like she won when she really lost. He got a taste of his own medicine. Why bother to complain about her dress? The perfect revenge is to have his wife show up to support him in one of Trump's rallies and outclass her. I expect that if Nikki surprises all the pundits and becomes President, Trump will do his usual flip and  graciously thank Nikki for pardoning Trump for his felonies.;neu

I'm a big supporter overall of Trump... but he will not win the Presidential Election because the exact same problems from the counting of votes in 2020 still exits today.

It's concerning and amusing at the same time seeing how well Trump has completely fooled his supporters into thinking he actually wants to buck the system.  He is a very good con-man, he understand human psychology.  He knows exactly what his base wants to hear and he gives that to them - words.  Everyone knows no republican has any chance to beat Trump in the primaries, and yet here they are basking and gloating in their victory.  When your choice is between two different parties running the same game on the population, you come to realize you actually have no choice at all...  You have been played by then system.;neu

I love how Donald accuses Nikki of doing a “victory lap” when he himself has been doing a four-year victory lap since he lost the election in 2020!;neu
Even for write-in, Biden’s showing was absolutely pathetic. Look at Trump in 2020. He was the incumbent President facing token opposition and he still motivated nearly 130,000 people to come and vote for him. If Kennedy hadn’t pussied out and run as an Independent, he’d have given Biden a serious black eye in New Hampshire. the dirty dems shut out RFK jr. at least a 1000th as much nastiness theyve displayed against trump and at least 74 million MAGA. cant blame the leftist though, their agenda is so anti american, the results are horrible, and theyre led by corrupt people that hate God.;neu

"I laugh when I hear that we (Americans) deserve a good president.  25% of college graduates don't possess basic skills in numeracy and 20% don't possess basic skills in literacy as the Wall Street Journal recently stated in an article.

These are the bright ones.  50% of our nation has voted for Trump 2 times in a row and are heading to vote again for him. 

75% of this nation deserve the worst president money can buy.  Is it any wonder that politicians with Trump leading the charge have zero regard for the people?  How can anyone have any respect for any of us when we can barely speak, write, or count?  Look at this speech by Trump - it's not a presidential speech by any means but more akin to a rant from Grease where Rizzo complains about Sandy to the other girls.";neu
Basically half the people that voted did not vote for him sorry but that's not going to cut it in the main election😊  independants arent going to vote for him.;neu

It's not shaping up to be a victory in the general election, look at the stats. Glad you all happy and excited to vote for the guy who can't win the general election.;neu
Hurry up, President Trump, Tim Scott, needs to get back to his, “girlfriend “;neu
Haley was helped by independent voters who lean Democrat in NH - plus - 4,000 Democrats who switched their party affilation to vote in the primary. They almost certainly all voted against Trump. And she still lost by double digits!;neu
This news is completely irrelevant, since the convicted, sex offender and fail, insurrectionist ex-president will soon be bankrupted, convicted, and incarcerated, and the Republicans will again lose a presidential election, no matter who they place on the ballot… despite the tacit endorsement of Forbes…;neu

Republicans....let us think again. Do you want trump who has very little to no respect at all for rule of law, democracy and peace to lead the great america? Trump is also signalling a dictatorial leadership style...its scary......so law abiding republicans do not let trump take the party on a roller coaster ride journey through 90 plus legal charges....vote responsibly.;neu

Haley was funded by billionaire Democrat donors in the NH primary. Haley received 70% of her votes from Democrats. Haley will never drop out even after she loses her home state of SC. Haley knows the fix is in and she'll become the nominee just as Hillary Rodham Clinton did. Haley is the chosen one by the military industrial complex. If no one believes this, ask Alexander Soros why he insinuated on X  that he would pay to have Trump taken out. The tweet was removed yesterday due to threatened violence.;neu

Go Trump go;neu
President Trump sounded petty and while he may be ahead now, but he is going to need a mix of voters who are not typical Trump voters.  Many women don’t like Trump because of this exact thing.  Following his comments both Kelly Ann Conway and Shawn Hannity said he missed an opportunity to run against Biden.  In fact, Trump elevated Gov Nikki by his rude and unnecessary comments.  I still am not convinced that the DNC will select Biden as their comment.  They always play the long game.  It is not inconceivable that at the last minute they will pick Michelle Obama “when they go low we go high”, and Trump will lose.  We cannot afford to have that happen!  I agree with Trump when he says if we lose, we are going to lose our country.  Every time he does great, he shoots himself in the foot.  Stop now!  Mr President, they HAVE weaponized the enforcement agencies and the courts, and the way you have been harassed throughout your presidency is abominable.  Don’t let them win now.  Be presidential!  Statesmen and Christians don’t act the way you did tonight.  This behavior is beneath you.  Thank you for being brave, for your fortitude in the face of overwhelming odds against you personally.  I am praying for you, your family, your safety.  Don’t blow it now.;neu

I think they Cheated--- Didn't everyone see them stuffing voting boxes and didn't you all see bags and bags of ballots being brought in.  The only way they could win is by cheating.

Clearly unable to rule itself allowing someone to stand accused of so much...  I’m so glad I don’t live in a Republic; what happened that January would never have happened with a Monarchy; a President has nobody to answer to – hence why they can do ridiculous things like pardon themselves. I would NEVER live in a Republic; God Save Our Great ad Queen!

"Judge in E. Jean Carroll Case: Yes, Donald Trump Is a Rapist
A judge rejected Trump’s semantic attempt to throw out the case.
On Wednesday, Trump’s request for a new trial in the E. Jean Carroll case, after he was found liable for sexual abuse, battery, and defamation, was rejected. And in his desperate attempt to avoid accountability, the twice-impeached and twice-indicted former president may have unintentionally allowed himself to now be formally known as a rapist.
Trump’s team had requested a new trial in the case, arguing that the $5 million in damages he was ordered to pay Carroll was excessive, because he was only charged with sexual abuse. The jury had not found that Trump “raped” Carroll, a talking point Trump’s team often parroted.
But Judge Lewis Kaplan called Trump’s semantic argument “entirely unpersuasive.” He clarified that the jury found that the former president did indeed “rape” Carroll based on the common definition of the word.
Kaplan noted that New York penal law (the jury in the Carroll case was based in New York) has a “far narrower” definition of the word “rape” than in “common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere.”
“The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’” Kaplan wrote.
“Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that [rape, as ‘commonly’ understood].”
“A United States District Judge has now formally held, in a lengthy written opinion, that it is perfectly appropriate, and, indeed, entirely accurate, to call a certain former President of the United States a rapist,” noted George Conway, lawyer and husband to former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway.
All that to say, based on the legal language, a rapist—for the third presidential cycle in a row—is leading the 2024 Republican primary.

And the only reason Haley got such good numbers is because of DEMOCRAT SUPPORT.";neu

Can you imagine having a President that took NO salary, put ALL American Citizens First, ran the country like a business instead of a party while increasing EVERYBODY'S spendable income and lifestyle, making us energy independent at a cheap price. Also increasingly making the country more safe with a stronger military, bringing back Manufacturing, and increasing the border security on a daily basis. Using his own plane, not taxpayers, which he acquired running his own successful businesses not government grants while providing thousands of American jobs. Playing golf at his own resorts at his own expense with his own money, not taxpayers. And during his FIRST hole at playing golf accomplishes more Making America Great Again then the Democrats have done in the past 100 years. Now go enjoy your trip to the gas station and grocery store this week while you're paying your utilities. WHILE you're out there be sure and talk to other American Citizens about how great things are now with Biden and the Democrats.;neu

Ah yea - shades of Hilary Clinton’s Russiagate election fraud / Treason attempt. The FBI, an ex-MI6 officer, Hilary , Obama and Biden run the greatest ever election fraud attempt , allege that Trump is a Russian spy , they produce evidence to that fact , get court warrants to spy on Trump , even bugging his phones at his business and the White House. When she got caught - Hilary suffered no punishment , along with everyone else involved. Just 4 years later Biden win an unlikely victory, without campaigning, and some highly questionable conduct at many of the voting locations. Even now, court cases are going in in Georgia regarding a missing 150,000 voting slips, believed shredded. It stinks . Rudi Giuliani was fined Millions of dollars for defaming Election officials - like Trump he committed ‘ thought crime ‘ -  just 4 years after Russiagate - the usual Democrat Corruption and hypocrisy;neu

Why is Biden a write in candidate?  I hate him but he should be on the ballot, right?;neu

What a Joke!!;pos
It's always amazing watching Democrat votes come in. Things get close between front runners. The unfavored one pulls ahead and suddenly a huge dump of votes for the favored candidate comes in with none or almost no votes for the unfavored and the the numbers just keep ticking at the same rate and spread as before the magical jump. You people are hilarious.;neu
Let's go trump we still in this;neu
Cheating again? Perfectly honest if I was biden I would have resign which is good this country and American people .Too old and done nothing but worst for this country. Don’t be dictator or greedy . God bless USA and free world . Amen🙏🙏🙏;neu

Joe Biden the most incompetent president in American history and the second worst president to date!  He is as advertised in 2020… corrupt and incompetent… now we can add incoherent.  Anointing candidates that hide in their basement to sit in the Oval Office has consequences!  FJB!;neu
"The undemocratic party at it's worst! Putting a senile old man ""in charge"" of this country is a joke! He's merely a puppet for the anti-American left.";neu

At 11:00 Biden suddenly got 2,000 more votes added without a single vote getting added to Phillips. That seems totally reasonable.;neu
The DNC wouldn't even let Kennedy on the ballot! Plus, the superdelegates really decide who the nominee is. Should be called the Undemocratic party.;neu

Remember when you MSNBC viewers were talking down at how little voters turned out for the Iowa caucus? Only 50,000 people showed up to vote, how pathetic while the temperaturewas in the negativs! Well only a 1,000 showed up for Biden and it was a nice day! 😅;neu

"Seriously? What are the numbers for the Democrat votes? You declared Biden the winner, even though if people, who knew their votes didn't matter, wanted to vote for him, they had to go through extra steps to write him in. I think you just broadcast an untruth. At 10:54, with 76 percent of precincts reporting, the vote count is a 30 vote difference between Biden and Phillips. (Phillips pulled ahead by 60 votes before I finished typing this.) Stop with your ""we can't air untruth!"" garbage. You are propaganda not news.";neu

Remember Democrats have sliding definitions of who wins and who get delegates. Remember this: After the New Hampshire contest, NBC News allocated 15 delegates to Sanders. But NBC also allocated 14 delegates to Hillary Clinton, who lost the primary by an almost historic margin. The answer has to do with a quirk unique to the Democratic Party called superdelegates. Yep, democrat voters do not pick their nominee.;neu
Have no idea how Biden won? Stupid.;neg
Alzheimer man is not there not even in ballot as expected weekend at Bernie’s style candidate!;neu

Raise our taxes to 38 or 40 % And when we get our school taxes raised so much we wont be able to keep our homes.The things that is most discusting is they are doing this for the illegals vote! IF YOU LOST A CHILD TO THIS MAYBE YOU WOULD THINK DIFFERENTLY .The border is still open most of these deaths were not from intentional drug use and you can still be affected by this. The Biden admin is still buying votes from the student loan payoffs that he found away around the sepreme court .VOTING FOR BIDEN IS VOTING FOR DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA;neu

"Really. Here are the facts as reported on the BBC - real television station with proper Journalist. 

The US economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year, driven by robust household and government spending.

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% over the three months to December, the Commerce Department said.
That was down from 4.9% in the prior quarter, but much faster than the 2% many analysts had expected.
For 2023, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022.
The figures cap a year that has been characterised by unexpected economic resilience, even as the US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply and inflation cooled.
""Whichever way you slice it, this report caps a year of stellar economic growth performance,"" said Olu Sonola, head of US regional economics at Fitch Ratings. ""The momentum of economic growth going into 2024 is looking very good.""
The figures are a boon for US President Joe Biden, who has struggled to convince the public that the economy remains healthy, as it downshifts from the boom after the pandemic shock.

Not bad for an old guy";neu

He IS the WORST!   He defends this disgusting illegal alien chaotic mess….And you only did this SELFISHLY, for your AGENDA, so they all vote Democrat.  NO AMNESTY for ANY OF THEM!!   Biden, you only let in a crazy amount of illegal aliens & their kids to SPITE Trump. It clearly has backfired on you.  Just maybe if you had a plan, and vetted them correctly, and did it methodically so there was control.  And an endgame in place, you would have shown you actually had intelligence & thought for the immigrants, American citizens & blue cities you have betrayed & wrecked, like NYC!  Biden let’s hope you can finish your current term, because you’re aging by the minute. Your gait is stiff, you mumble, and fall down… just the traits we want in our next President.;neu

I find it unbelievable how the USA find its Presidents.Trump would be a none starter or  considered as suitable for any government post, here in the UK a, here a serial sex pest would be a non runner in Politics,  A lawsuit filed in California in April 2016 accused Trump and Epstein of forcibly raping three 12 and 13-year-old girls at underage sex parties at Epstein's Manhattan residence in 1994. The case was dismissed the following month.A month before the 2016 presidential election, a leaked tape revealed Donald Trump bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, captured on a hot mic during a 2005 “Access Hollywood” taping. Dozens of women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1970s, and he has been found liable in court for sexual abuse. Several women have described Trump forcibly reaching under their skirts, others said he kissed them without consent, and a handful of beauty pageant contestants claimed Trump inappropriately walked in on them in changing rooms. In total, about two dozen women have spoken out publicly to accuse Trump: Remember 18 of these women came forward before Trump even ran for the W.H in 2016, so it can't be pinned on Democrats;neu

I voted for Trump twice and will do so again this November. Joeschmo Pinocchio and Esmerelda are finished.;neu
As well as the Clintons and Obamas;neu
Defendant Trump was easily the worst President in American history and if, God forbid, he gets in the White House again we're doomed.;neu
Donald trump was the very worse president.    Trumps a criminal rapist.  Egomaniac evil nasty.  How can you even say that.   Biden has integrity.      Trump wants to be a dictator.    I hate trump.;neu

Yes he is and Obama was a close second between the pair of them they have nearly destroyed your country and the liberty you guys used to treasure so much ,hopefully for America trump will be able to save America if it’s not already to late;neu
Biden is just another corporate shill who only represents his wealthy campaign donors.;neu
Not one of the worst, but the worst. So much so it's difficult to believe it hasn't been intentional.;neu

Hi Taylor i know you'll never see this but if somehow u do out of ur 10,000,000 comments but i just wanted to say this. I'm such a big fan ive listened to you since i was 3 i love all of ur music so much. I got so excited when I heard you were coming to my town for the eras tour. But i couldn't get any tickets. I cried about for weeks. Then i saw ur eras tour movie so we went. But i am still sad because i realized i cant go on ur adventure of 17 years of music. So then i figured out that u were coming back to a few places like malibu and Toronto. Then i figured out its only 5 hours from where i live. My birthdays in a few months so thats all im asking for. I also am now spending every minute i get to make bracelets for my shop to get tickets. So far j need to sell over 5,000 but I'm willing to do it. I also just wanted to say that ur my biggest inspiration and every day all i listen to is u and i watch videos of the eras tour. I wanna be a famous singer just like u. i love u and ur music so much. If i save up enough i hope to see u there. (Hopefully) Im ur biggest fan and i cant explain how amazing u are. You are a queen and never forget that.- CRC;neu

"Hi taylor...you will never read this but i finally am sending this. I am so proud of you. The moment I started liking you, i knew you were underrated and you will make it to the top. The story of how I got to know about you is very interesting. When I was probably 8 or 9 my mom was in the bathroom playing her music, when I heard it. Yup, i heard the song love story. I used stand outside of the bathroom everyday just hearing that song, as i wasn't really allowed to listen to music at that time. I slowly learnt the lyrics of that song and one day, went and asked my friend of she knows this song. She was a huge fan of you and i heard her talk about you a loooot. Then she screamed and told me that's taylor swift. That name brought to this amazing new world that I'm in now. My mom saw how attached i was to this song, and finally let me start listening to music. I downloaded every song of yours(which did not have bad words cuz we'll hea was not allowed). I made sure every friend of mine and my mom follows you. I made sure my parents drove three hours just to see your movie. I am now celebrating 5 years if knowing you and can't believe how I spent more than half of my lofe not knowing you. I love the messages you convey, and i know the eras tour is not coming here but I'm proud of you taylor and thank you for getting me out of depression, anxiety, panic attacks and well getting me through my teenage life.
Love from India.❤️";neu

"Hey Taylor! I'm sure that you get comments like this all the time, but i wanted to say this anyway. My mom and i weren't able to attend the eras tour, but we did watch the movie in the theater, and it made us both cry. You are an incredible musician and performer, and we loved every second of it. I have been learning some of your music on piano, and the way you perfectly intertwine your lyrics is amazing. Your music is always playing in our house, and it fills me with joy to see that so many other swifties love you this much too! Im sending so much love to you!

Dear Taylor, my name is Arturo, I am a Venezuelan pilot who works in Kazakhstan and has his family residing in Spain. I don't know if this message reaches you because of the number of followers you have, but the effort is worth it. First I want to thank you for recovering music with prose and content, that has inspired my daughter Alejandra who has delved deeper into music in recent years and I am happy to know that she has been inspired by your style, and inspired by your wonderful life story. Seeing and listening to Alejandra as she enjoys and lives each song reminds me of my teenage days. The truth is that Alejandra’s birthday 12th will be on December 29, and as a father excited to give his daughter details that she will never forget, beyond any material gift, it would be extraordinary to get a message from you, I know you will be very busy in these dates, however I do not lose hope of being graced and honored with your words, and I know every use of your image has its price. Anyway what happen, I wish to you and your family a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year with many more successes, health and, above all, joy. Thanks in advance for reading me.;neu

Bài gì vậy mng;neu
"Piath: Taylor, I've been reflecting on the nature of truth. It seems like a simple issue, but the more I think about it, the more complex it becomes.

Taylor: That's true, Piath. Truth can have many faces. From a philosophical perspective, for example, there are various theories. The correspondence theory holds that truth corresponds with reality, while the coherence theory sees truth as coherence within a system of beliefs.

Piath: Exactly, Taylor. When we look at science, truth is based on constant observation and experimentation. But even in science, ""truths"" can change with new discoveries.

Taylor: That makes me think about the religious and spiritual dimension, where truth is often associated with divine teachings or universal moral laws. Each tradition has its particular vision.

Piath: And moreover, each individual has their own subjective perspective of truth, based on personal experiences and perceptions. My truth might be very different from yours.

Taylor: That's true. And that's without considering the impact of culture and society on what we consider truth. What is true in one culture may not be so in another.

Piath: That's why I think that the search for truth is a dynamic process. It requires an open mind, constant critical examination, and the willingness to adapt our understandings.

Taylor: You're right, Piath. Truth isn't a matter of black or white; it's a spectrum of greys, always in motion and evolving with new perspectives and information. It's truly a continuous adventure in our exploration of the world.";neu
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH TAYLOR!❤;pos

"Finally got around to watching Taylor Swift: Eras Tour concert film online for free
Crazy I had to wait 2 months 

The film is long as you'd expect a concert performance would be so it is strictly for hardcore lovers
Even if that's the case you have to admit you can't deny her enthusiasm and commitment to perform for everyone
Like any artist or band the fans really make the success work
The scope, style, and size of this is tremendous and really catches your eye, everything from the lighting to the staging is spectacular 
Taylor expresses brilliantly through her music how far she has come through invention and self-reinvention 
In our current IP-based age of content there's still ways to please the consumers 
The 3 hour running time is staggering but all Swifties will gobble up every second of Taylor pouring her heart out on stage";neu
"What a joke

Lmao";pos
im here just wainting that Tay could come to LATAM againg ( Peru and more countries ) 😪;neu
I wish I could come there ):;neu
Hey Taylor I know you won’t see this I just want you to know your my idol and you have brought me and my freind closer going to your concert your the best 🫶;neu

OK, I have to admit I do love her music and she's badass. I didn't think I'd watch this, but I did. And she's way more phenomenal than I had ever thought!! Amazing person and amazing show!! ❤ now I can imagine how it was to be there in person!!;neu
"She's so perfect bros..  ;_;";neu
Super!;pos
We need all her songs on a vinyl, put it on a rocket and send it into space for all to discover.;neu
i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu;neu
The most overrated singer of all time;neu
Fun fact:every day she goes on a treadmill and sings the whole set!;neu
This made me cry bc I can't go 😅😢;neu
Ничего в ней хорошего нет. Голос неприятного тембра, резкий. Песни немелодичные, совсем не хиты. MADONNA and LADY GAGA намного лучше поют! And Elton John forever!!!;neu
I remember Maddona's Girlie Show  was coming to Puerto Rico, and I was so exited to see her. Then I missed it because my dad punished me. Lol. I am a fan of a few of Taylor's songs, and I am watching her show on the internet, in one of those sites that are free. Wink. I am enjoying it. We....are never ever getting back together! I am 47, and just broke up with someone...that is my song!;neu
She is the perfect example of all the beautiful quotes written for women for their hard work, creativity and so on she is just the best ❤❤❤❤❤Really difficult to find flaws in her concert....she's way to perfect❤❤❤;pos
Taylor Swift I love you and you are my idol I wish I could see you in your concerts but your tickets sell out so quickly 😅anyways love y’all swifties!!! Byeee;neu

How much is concert ticket ?;neu
Taylor bestest!;neu
Can’t argue with her success which is great and wonderful, but I personally don’t understand how this is even considered “music”. It’s like MacDonald’s, because so many consume it, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is a quality product.;neu
Love it!;pos
Taylor if you see this comment I just wanna say great movie and you and Travis are meant to be together happy holiday sorry I couldnt make it to the eras tour but at least I have the movie😁🎄;neu

The Eras tour popped  up on my TV on-demand section today and I decided to finally give Taylor Swift a listen because people keep talking about her . I was shocked when I  discovered that she was the artist behind most of my favorite songs on the radio while driving my truck to work. I have been a Taylor swift fan all this time without realizing it.    😂;neu
I LOVE;pos
OG Swiftie here! I just watch it this morning! Was the best thing I’ve ever watched! Thank you Taylor, for such an amazing movie and I’m so proud of how far you’ve come! Congratulations on the movie and the tour! Love you so much, Tay❤️;neu

Hi Taylor ('s assistant?)! NPR just did a story about someone donating gold Air Jordans and their collab with Sotheby's to auction them, at no fee, with all proceeds going to the Portland, OR homeless services agency. They hope to get $15,000-$20,000 at auction for these very special shoes. Or you could get Travis a nice gift for the holidays and make sure this agency get s double or triple that amount!;neu

HI TAYLOR!!! PLEASE READ THIS!!! 🥰🩷My name is Mia, I am 12 years old and I’m a Swiftie! I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MUSIC SOOOO MUCH! I love all of ur songs but my favorites are: 1. Love Story, 2. Sparks Fly, 3.Lover, 4. Blank Space, 5. You Belong with Me, 6. Cruel Summer 7. 22, 8. We are Never Ever getting back Together!!! I commented because i wanted to say “HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY TAY TAY! You are the best singer in the world, and u are so pretty, SO BEAUTIFUL! I love u sooo much!” I wish I could go to your Eras Tour tommorow!! I love that it’s on your birthday! IT SEEMS SOOOO FUN!!!So Cute! I hope you have a great day tommorow, and that all your dreams come true and that nothing goes wrong! ☺️ Btw, it might just be rumors (i don’t think so but maybe)but if it’s true, when it started raining at one of ur Tours/Concerts I was thinking, you should’ve sang Sparks Fly! 🤍It would’ve been so cute if when u sang: “Drop Everything Now, meet me in the pouring rain, kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain! Cause I see, Sparks fly, whenever you smile! Hit me with those green eyes baby, as the lights go down, give me something that’ll haunt me when ur not around! Cause i see, Sparks, Fly, whenever you, smile!” And at the part of “Meet me in the pouring rain, kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain your “boyfriend” (idk if its just rumors) Travis Kelce, comes out into the pouring rain, walks to you and kisses you on stage!!! 🤍 I think it would’ve been so cute and romantic!!! Idk, i think so, but if its just rumors pls dont ate upset at me! Ty 🩷 Ok, Happy Birthday Taylor! Ty for reading my comment, i rlly appreciate it! Ima copy this onto some of ur other music videos so u can read it! Byeee!🩷🎉🎁🥳😄;neu

I can’t tell you how much I appreciate that Taylor is streaming the movie.  My son (12) is autistic and teaching himself to play piano and trying to learn some of  Taylor’s music.  Going to a movie theater has been a bit outside of our of our budget the last few years so the fact that he gets to see it at home is amazing!!!  ❤❤  Being able to see the movie at home during the holiday season is just the icing on the cake!!  So freaking excited!  He’s going to get an acoustic guitar for Christmas and I’m sure the first songs he learns will be Taylor’s.;neu

I LOVED GOING TO THE THEATERS TO WATCH THIS;neu
"Hi Taylor I just wanted to let you know that you are my favorite person in the whole world and I would love to meet you someday. I am 10 years old I live in Wisconsin and my mom was the football game Packers versus Chiefs and she was there with my aunt and when they told me they were going and you were going to be there I was so jealous. I literally told them that I needed to go, but they told me I couldn’t so I was so sad that night. And I am not that big of a football fan. I went to your eras tour movie in the theater I got the posters and the The  cups and the popcorn buckets I went with 4 of my friends we had the time of your lives it was so fun. I hope you see this and write me back I would love that and I know almost every single one of your songs and my favorite album. really decide but it probably would have to be Lover or red. Love you so much. Hope you write me back it’s fine if you don’t.

whether you like her or not, you need to admit she is an incredible woman. She had so many personal and career problems, but she never let it stop her from being this unexplainably amazing person. I got goosebumps and my hand was shaking a little while watching this. I was at the Eras Tour and that was one of the most incredible, insane and amazing experience i ever had. Everyone was singing, cheering, dancing and screaming for 3 hours nonstop. I’m a new swiftie and I feel so much love and appreciation for Taylor, her music and her story. Still can’t explain all this in words, and you guys probably have other things to do today, but thanks for reading! I love you Taylor :> 🩵 (sorry for any english mistakes!);neu

I hate those who think Taylor's songs are cool, she sings badly, and copies songs from other artists, those who went to The Eras Tour, wasted their time, and must have regretted going, she will never be a queen, she already She has a lot of money, and you're wasting your time, which you could be doing other things, but no, you listen to her music. But everyone has their own opinion;neu
I'm scared. Zombies listening same song for 3 hours straight and paying for this 2k dollars.;neu
I watch this movie : ticket price is $ 20 , -;neu

A lack of respect for the Brazilian public, leaving fans roasting in the heat, feeling ill to worship the Goddess. While the little princess is in the air conditioning, watching the fans suffering. Respect the fans!;neu

Hi!  Environmental impact of this tour?  Glad Taylor has so many fans who are enjoying this tour! Think of just the clothing.  Will they be cleaned & stored or will they be auctioned off & Taylor will purchase the Amazon rainforest & preserve it for the planet & future generaetions?  Or will the clothes go into a landfill or be burned as junk?  Lots of fuel was used to transport the people, musical instruments, stage sets, clothing, etc.   How did Taylor make her trips carbon neutral?;neu
Taylor, you are an indispensable part of my daily life!;neu

Thanks for superpower contributions that Swift has been influencing the planet's music, so much talent, wholehearted and kind singer, songwriter, producer and a wonder girl!!!;neu

"I'm coming home from this special movie. I've always been a enormous fan... Taylor not only gave me the most precious music, but also faith in myself, she is so strong, she came all this way, she is so talented and incredible, that I don't have the words to tell her my gratitude. She is my model !! The movie was simply perfect. And since I don't have the money to see the real Tour, I was deeply touched by this idea, and sincerely amazed by the result ! Thank you for everything you do for us Taylor Swift, you are the best. 
Yours forever,
Maya - a french fan of yours";neu

"Well, I am a fancy of Taylor Swift and I consider this film is perfect due to it makes you feel like you are in her concert and I believe that  is one of the best feelings. 
The plot is brilliant and the soundtrack even more and I'm inclined to believe that even though you aren't a big fan of Taylor you would enjoy this film. 
It is a strange kind of film but as far as I'm concerned it's an incredible idea to do this film.";neu

Taylor Swift is a real artist in true sense. The portrayal of her thoughts via songs are worth listening 🎶 to. Her public interactions after singing some songs were natural, the audience felt connected to her. That's impressive. This concert has stunning visuals, colorful light show, breathtaking choreography, etc. The majority of the audience sang & danced on most of the songs. That's a musical journey in itself. It's a must watch. Thanks, Taylor 🩵.;neu

Taylor, I’m 70 years old and I’m sure you may never see this post but I am so grateful for your heart, love and generosity that you share with the world. I lost my daughter in a tragic accident in 2003. She was also a bright light to everyone she met. She was a writer and a poet kind loving and tremendously beautiful just like you. She spoke her truth through her poetry and I’m so grateful that you are using your platform to do the same. You are here at this time for a reason far beyond even you can comprehend. I send you love and light. Stand in your truth sweet girl, the world needs it. 💕;neu
For me taylor swift is a representative of the 2012 era. and she always tries to give the best to her fans. This tour she tried to give her best. and she is the only one from her era who is still consistent on the world tour so far. she's was born for this.;neu

"I don’t like how the audio of the concert film was  produced in cinemas..the instrumental or bg music was louder than her singing voice..I’m  kind of disappointed..
I hopefully i can watch her concert in our country  😢";neu
"Taylor, challenge yourself. 

Write better songs. focus on better things rather than just writing about men, guys, crushes, etc. 

Celebrities with that level of fan following should understand the impact they can create with just a lyric and a song. 
Make better use of it, Taylor.";neu
Most beautiful singer forever ...;pos
Is this documentary backstage/ how she prepared the show? or the tour itself?;neu
We love you taylor;pos

Best cinema experience I've ever had.;neu
"It was virtually impossible to get tickets to see her this time, BUT I say it all the time, the woman is a Genius! 
She actually cares about her fans and made a way for those who couldn’t get tickets to still be involved 🫶🏼

I couldn’t get tickets to Era’s, but I was there opening night of this in the movie theater!

It was Everything 🔥
It was like being at her concert in the way that everyone in the audience was clapping, singing, and whooping it up just like you would at a live show! 

I’m so very grateful Taylor provided this option for her fans to have a different way to experience this concert 🫶🏼";neu
but still taylor is my fav sinhger tho;neu
Taylor, I know you won't see this. But I am on top of the WORLD because I can say that I've seen this movie in my local cinema! I love you SO much ❤;neu
I love this girl, she is so endearing and kind.  I am 57yrs old and absolutely love her.  I watched her show in the cinema and it gave me serious goosebumps.  So actually being at her concert must be mind blowing.;neu
steve martin found better than jim c. with continuity;neu

Taylor is the best artist of music 🎶;neu

We are not a couple, you were very convincing;neu
"This tour can never stop. Still, everyone won’t have time to watch it. And someone will want to watch it several times. If you give 40 concerts a year, then it will take only 4,000 years for 8 billion earthlings to watch it, if the stadiums have a capacity of 50,000 spectators;)";neu

Just saw it in the theater yesterday and the netflix doc the day before and became a fan. I've slowly been working my way though her discography over the last couple of weeks to see what the fuss was about and the more I heard the more I liked her but now I absolutely love her. Really really hope she puts this out on Blu Ray, it was such a great theater concert experience!;neu
Omg I’m litterly crying;neg

I love the outfits and your music Taylor!!!!! I wish I could meet you;neu

"i am actually, in tears, taylor alison swift, she is so insperational, motivational, and i dont know what to say, i am speechless.. shes right, 17 years of music leads us to today, where we scream and cry our hearts out to her music, whether we are in our bedrooms on a typical tuesday night, or in the movies watching the movie concert for 2:48 minutes. or in SoFI stadium, or somewhere else across the world at her eras tour. 

i love you taylor.";neu

"I understand that this movie has earned around 100 million worldwide on opening weekend alone. Will probably beat out Titanic. And she keeps 57% of profits since she did not use major studio distribution. Take that Hollywood.
Just a sideline spectator enjoying a bit of a reality twist.";neu
"They said, ""Going to theaters worldwide."" Isn't Nigeria a country in this world?? And we have plenty theatres, and It's not in our theatres yet. @Taylorswift Puhlease swifties in Nigeria are dying to watch this movie!!!!

เสียงไพเราะและทรงพลังรอยยิ้มอย่างธรรมชาติราวกับว่าเธอร้องสดทุกเพลงโดยไม่เหน็ดเหนื่อย ทุกอย่างดูกลมกลืน อลังการและตื่นตาตื่นใจ สร้างสรรค์อย่างน่าประทับใจทุกฉากช่วงเวลาตลอดการแสดง เสื้อผ้า ฉากประกอบ ทุกอย่างถูกจัดวางทั้งหมดอย่างปราณีตเพื่อให้เข้ากับโชว์ทุกชุดที่แตกต่างกัน แม้กระทั่งสีเล็บ ไมค์ ขาตั้ง ไวเลสก็ยังถูกทำให้แมตช์กับชุดของเธอ ซึ่งมันไม่ซ้ำกันเลย และคิวบนเวทีของเธอนั้นเป๊ะมาก ทุกคนทำงานเป็นทีม  ทำให้โชว์นั้นสมบูรณ์แบบมากๆ ฉันซาบซึ้งใจและประทับใจสุดๆ แม่ว่าฉันจะได้ดูแค่ในโรงหนังแต่ก็ประทับใจมากจริงๆ มันสุดยอดมากๆขอบคุณที่ฉายในโรงภาพยนต์เพราะฉันคงแย่งบัตรและบินไปดูไม่ได้แน่ๆ แต่ที่อยากจะบอกคือเธอมันเจ๋งมากเทเลอร์สวิฟเป็นคอนที่ดีในชีวิตของฉัน ขอบคุณ 😊😊😊😊;neu

Taylor, is not Just a simple Artist, she is too much more than so, now with her 17 years experienced of music and the way she had fights by Music Rights about being trade by discographic owners that made her rewrite her owns Album Today Taylor is Iconic she moves a lots of fan I do not know if she is more Than Jhon Lennon or Maddona or Elthon Jhon by She is Such An Special Woman and Musitian that she lives on many Peoples Mind;neu
I SAW IT ITS SOO GOID;neu
WOW!!! AMAZING;pos
Taylor is so incredibly sweet and kind to put one of her concerts in theaters for the people who couldn’t make it to the actual shows. She’s not just one of the celebrities who goes around thinking she’s more important than everyone else, she’s someone who thinks that everyones feelings are more important than her own. Love you Taylor ❤;neu
"I love you

Whether you like her or not, you have to give her credit for performing for 3 hours straight. That's hard work!;neu
"The fact that you're price gouging your fans is sickening! I love your music but Girl you need to get off your ""I'm untouchable"" bs! How much money do you need to take from families? You seriously just put yourself in the same category as Kim K, just for the simple fact that greed and vanity are apparently your only trait! Not a fan anymore. And your charities you pretend are helpful are for you to gain more praise. Did you know that is also morally incorrect right? Did you know it's possible to make music and not be a sell out?! Ani Difranco has been doing it since the 90s and runs her own record company but she doesn't do, is sell herself out to millions for millions! She plays small vendors and actually holds true to her fans. Girl, come back down to earth!";neu

Day 1 of being subscribed to Taylor Swift and asking this - Dinner? Maybe?;neu
Taylor hope you understand that Jesus is real and what ur doing is wrong. By saying that you don’t have to forgive people, you just have to move on. Well, it says in the Bible to enter heaven, you have to forgive everyone.🥹☺️;neu
I'm blessed that I'm living in the same time as Taylor 😭❤️;neu

Taylow Swift really knows the definition of an ARTIST;neu
Hi swifties I have a question to ask you.. So my dad hates Taylor while I love how sweet she is and her music but I don’t know how to tell him I’m a fan (the reason he hates her is that he thinks she has no talent and is mean but that’s not true also sidenote the only song of hers he has ever heard is shake it off and let’s be honest not her best vocals). So any ideas on how to tell him? I’m eleven btw;neu
"I saw the concert in the movie theater and I am just saying...WOW! 
I thought it was an amazing and a spectacular show🎤😮😄💃🕺😍. 
I think I am a Swiftie now😊.
Thank you Taylor Swift. I was enchanted to meet you❤
Greetings from Finland.";neu
I'm not sure whether to see this or Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie...those pups are so damn cute;neu
So swift of her to make a movie for the swifties who unfortunately couldn’t get to her concert for some reason or other. Thank you @Taylorswift. I’ll be there! At the movies anyways. 😅 Rock on 🎸🎤💃🎫👗. 🚦🎥🎬.;neu

The young have never had worse taste than in this generation. Of all the music that is produced in our generation, 97% is junk music. Tayler Swift is an example of how bad taste our last two generations have. The music industry/companies give up, as long as they make money from junk music.;neu

Wow my sister had watched this movie 🎥 and I was at my friends;neu
"""I remember all too well"" The cinematic for the Eras Tour movie was an absolute masterpiece, the greatest experience of all time 😍 It was insane, Taylor Swift is a storyteller and the Queen of pop";neu
Hmmm. Swift (Beyonce, Rolling Stones, U2, etc.) has discovered the key to success in 21st century pop music. When you really don’t have all that much to say, go big.;neu
Just saw the movie and I cried. No joke. The Eras Tour Movie has ruined all other movies. ♾️/5 as a rating.;neu
I love her so much but why can't she come to NC?;neu
I wouldn't touch that  thing with a 20 mile pole;neu

I LOVE U SO MUCH😭😭😭😭😭😭;neg
Thank you Taylor for the movie it is awesome ❤❤❤;pos
I got to see this in IMAX and I get what the Swifties know. Very impressive show with amazing visuals and sound design. Taylor’s use of the stage and her dancers keep the show moving. I felt like this was a great introduction to Taylor Swift’s catalog of music and know that this will be a must own for fans when it gets a home release. Well done Taylor Swift!!!;neu
i LOVE her so much;pos
This was AMAZING!! Thank you Taylor and co! Loved this so much! I got to be a part of the Eras Tour after all! Can’t even begin to tell you how awesome this was!! 💕🫶🤘;neu

I saw this movie. I can't say I'm a close follower of Taylor Swift. I do like many of her songs. Seeing her on stage, she has such an enormous impact. I'm not sure why some people don't like her, but I suppose it is to be expected. She sings great, her dance moves are very interesting. I see so many types of subtle moves, and how she moves her eyes reminds me of Thai Royal dancers. She is truly amazing, and seeing the audience swoon over her was a sight to see. I admit she got a few tears out of this guy, too.;neu

Hi I'm watching the eras concert in  the drive thru movie theayer;neu
mother swift 😍;pos
This is my honest opinion. What goes through my head is, this is being shown at a movie theatre and people will be acting like a concert being all loud and jumping. Put this into perspective…. It’s just a screen showing you Taylor.. why do people have to go super nuts like it’s a concert.. doesn’t this seem really weird in a way guys? Just wanna hear what you guys say. Lol;neu
im going to the cinema on oct 21 to watch this! but when will you release this digitally so i can watch it again at home?;neu

cant wait!!!!! 🎉;neg
Was this a trailer for Idiocracy 2?;neu
"Ok..one question:
Where’s her band? 
She made them hide behind stage? Or is her band’s music mainly just prerecorded tracks? 

Weird /sad what’s going on with the state of pop music today. It’s basically American idol with dancing etc. I guess that it’s always existed for some artists. 

Musicianship has no place in the Swifty world live shows anymore apparently…well at least she still has an acoustic guitar lol.";neu
SHES IN EUROPE NEXT YEARRRR;neu
I’m definitely can’t wait to see the movie ahh I love you so much Taylor thank you 🙏🥺;neu

No, this is not the story of Cinderella who got married successfully. This is the story of Cinderella, who herself turned into a prince who, like Baron Munchausen, pulled herself out of the swamp of the middle class to the throne of the musical and financial Olympus. Deserves respect;neu
Love you so much;pos
saw this today and it was one of the most magical nights of my life.;neu

I’m staying in a state that the eras tour was not conducted. I didn’t get the tickets to eras tour and this screening in the cinemas in genius of her. The videographic of the era tour is no joke just pure epic. It felt like I was there! And honestly I think this was worth my money and what I can ever wish for near to getting the ticket to the eras tour and am truly happy. Love you Taylor for making ALL the fans included 🤍;neu
This was an amazing experience.;neu
SLAYYYYYYYY!!! I'm going to watch her tomorrow at my local cinema, it's going to be flawless!!!;neu
0:49 long live😪;neu

I watched the movie and it is ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!! (im editing this after 2 months, I sadly can't watch the movie home cuz i don't have an credit/debit😭😭);neu
I just watched it yesterday;neu
Not really receptive to her artistic concept but there aren't many people in the world who should command so much admiration for her working abilities. Best wishes;neu
The energy in the movie theatre that I went to was just amazing. Thank you for this opportunity to have that little concert in a little country.;neu

This movie was one of the best nights of my life. Please go if you can. In my movie theatre we may have been strangers but we were so connected in that moment. We laughed together, screamed together and cried together. My voice is sore and my heart is elated. <33;neu
BEST CONCERT FILM EVER!;pos
I’m not a Taylor Swift fan I know some songs.. I’m a movie goer. My sister and I went to this today and it was the best concert movie I’ve seen in a long time. 10/10!;neu
BEST TRAILER EVER MADE I SWEARR;neu
Just watched this today. Beautiful.;neu
Taylor is the 2023 solo artist  version of Beatlemania;neu
"I LOVED it and I am a grandma!! I can't take my 80 year old disabled dad to see her live BUT I got to take him to the Movie! Another check on the bucket list! We loved it. 

I love how she released it during the tour so that those who can't physically get to the concert can still be a part of it. Just wish there was more merch like frienship bracelets, and shirts there!  

You can see and feel the positive energy between Swift and her fans, the love she has for her fans, AND the love between her and her entire crew. She really appreciates the fans and everyone up on stage with her and it shows. She is genuine.

I did cry too when she gave Kobe's daughter the hat and a hug. 

LOVE TAYLOR SO MUCH.

Hope she has phenomenal success in Europe!

Hugs
Patrice";neu
Who else is seeing this tomorrow 😂;neu

I love how she is extremely smart at being a self advocate and business woman aside from her singing and sing writing. ❤❤❤;neu
This has been the most extraordinary experience of her life. For an artist, songwriter, singer, performer as great as Taylor that is an amazing statement. Wow.;neu
I am a big fan of her;neu
Thanks but no thanks.;neg
Not a swifty;neu
I NEED TO GOOOOOOO MY BESTIE IS GOING I WOULD GO WITH HER BUT ITS FRICKIN SOLD OUT;neu

Wait Taylor Swif and Selena buy Youtube and ask the 🤓 to delete those accounts 💥, keep making concert in SEA countries with free promos. Please pay your fans;neu
Im going tonight and i am SO excited to watch it😭😭;neu
Came out from the opening day screen,  amazing show. Kudos to the art director, and the vision of the show. It even showed angles not in the live show, although there is never a sub for live music. Settled for IMAX sound. We even got out our seats, and danced, especially 1989.;neu
"I know Taylor says she is a christian which i applaud. 
She is 33 years old and wants everyone to love her. However, to be an advocate for a womans right to chose, an LBGTQ+ supporter, she needs to become a bit more of aware of the Christian view on these issues. Look forward to seeing her Eras movie documentary.";neu
I just watched and had the most amazing experience of my life but when i go to the tour it's gonna be 100000000000000000000x better!!;neu
TS;neu
Hey Taylor, I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I went to the cinema today to see the eras tour film and I've never experienced anything so exciting and beautiful. When we heard the song Shake It Off, we all jumped up and danced at the front of the screen. It was simply breathtaking  ❤️ I think if I saw this live I would faint 😅Thank you for everything you did💝 Kind regards from Maya from Austria;neu
Taylor I LOVE YOUUUUU❤❤❤❤;pos

This is fantastic for those who can never afford a Taylor Swift concert. I hope the kids and adults sit on the edge of their seats and drink in the impossible. And note how, at the 1:07 mark, above her head, is a double rainbow. She is a wonderful LGBTQ supporter.;neu

Taylor I love you so much and I want to be just like you and you are the one who got me into singing and you maid me believe that just because I talk differently I still have a spot in the singing world I love you so much;neu
Taylor Swift, can you please cover a Whitney Houston song and prove to the doubters you have vocals and can actually sing. I'm hearing from so many people that all you do is talk loudly when you sing. Prove them wrong with a Whitney cover!;neu
Hey let's goooooo;neu

I am so excited I am literally about to cry Taylor plays such a big role in my life and she always has and connected with me through her music Taylor if you read this comment I just want you to know that you rock and are the best musician ever I read the book that you made with little golden books and I just love you music from 6yo me listening to shake it off with my sister to driving home sticking my head out the window jam in out to twenty two to listening to paper rings in the shower to having a party with my friends and singing to you belong with me together you rule Taylor and I can’t wait to see where your music takes you if you are ever having a show in Florida let me know so I can get tickets I love you Taylor and your music!;neu
We got last minute concert tickets for her last night in LA and that was so unbelievable! My favorite album is 1989 and her announcing Taylor’s version that night was so amazing. I wasn’t that much of a swiftie but after that night I was turned. I surprised myself somehow knowing the words to all her songs. It made me realize how much I love her. Taylor is such an inspiration.;neu
Taylor....please present a concert in NZ soon.  Lindsay Evans;neu

She somethin else, i tell u whuuuut;neu

Cool singer. 👍Cool music Taylor swift.;neu
I’m going tomorrow🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉;pos
Is the movie going to have, “now we have bad blood, stop, hey stop, she wasn’t doing anything”?;neu
Taylor Swifts bank account moves faster than the US debt clock. 💸;neu
damn, maybe Taylor should run for president.she does have common sense.That's probably better than what we got.. Actually the Dems would find a way to beat her too... Wait, maybe they already have 😮;neu

Some say there’s no Long Live included in the movie. How come this happened? I saw a glimpse of it in the trailer. How can this memorable song between her and the fans be cut off? This is tragic.;neu
0:49;neu
They say The Archer has been cut out. Which is ridiculous since it’s CLEARLY HERE IN THE TRAILER;neu

Dear Taylor, you need to do a big push for Cruel Summer this week. This song could have already been #1 on the hot 100 if you made a video or promoted it in any way. The movie comes out Friday and Cruel Summer needs a music video the same day!  It should be a live performance video from the tour. Easy. This song deserves to be #1!  We have been streaming it like crazy. We just need your assistance please.;neu

Saw you in little rock after Kellie Pickler opened for you and after Pickler the show took a downfall and from then forward sucked. You think you're a real performer with all that drama acting on stage and walking through the crowd singing nothing but songs talking about how sorry a man is. I would like my $50.00 back!;neu
slayy;neu
All her concerts are sold out so wouldn't it be wonderful if she put a big screen streaming what's happening inside the stadium for all us desperate Swifties who couldn't get or couldn't afford a ticket and are sitting in the carpark!;neu

She can't dance;neu
"Swifties, I'm so proud of our Taylor and of us as well. I feel so powerful to see her become this powerful, this beautiful, nurtured,  matured and professional human. I'm crying right now seeing her evolution although iknow this is not the end. She always has more to offer us when I almost think there's nothing left. She makes it all possible. It's such a great and wholesome feeling to watch her become this big. She writes so much, creates so much and goes on tours as well like she's been always enjoying her work, her music, being with us. It makes me so proud, I'm a proud swiftie.

Although what I'm saying below this might be out of context. Now that I look back on, that whole kanye kim beefs, and red not winning for album of the year grammy, this was all necessary to happen for us to watch her new creations. And also with her record labels issues, although I was sad at that time for her but it's okay now bc I got to relive my old days with her old albums. It was all so nostlagic.";neu
All her songs sound the same!;neu
How can she sing continuously for 3.5 hours 😮;neu

I used to like her, but after charging over £600 pounds a ticket for no matter where your standing in the stadium, floor, front or back... I lost all respect for her. Don't blame it on Ticketmaster because her managers are fully aware of it and do nothing whatsoever about it... because there in on it !!!. Thus only rich kids get to go and the real fans from poor background just get snubbed off !!;neu
AND IM GONNA SEE IT WITH MY SWIFTIE;neu

Wait... Could this leat to an oscar for her? For best original song? If its being released as a film.. and Cruel Summer is tagged as its lead song.. couldn't that pick up a nomination for it? That would be pretty damned amazing for a VERY overlooked song. (Not in taylor world but regular world its an overlooked song.. as Lover is an overlooked album lost to the pandmeic like a lot of other things);neu

"As a Belieber I’m waiting for Justin to feed us the way T Swift has been FEEDING her fans. 
This is so cute";neu
Taylor Swift is such an iconic artist now and she made a big hit in her music career. Taylor started her music at the age of 13yrs old and she made a big impact on her fans and based off of her music over the years they have gotten better because they're sounding more emotional and more lively and I like her new album and some of her old ones ☺;neu
I’m glad to be a Swiftie again. I loved Taylor since kindergarten in 2008, and I became obsessed. In 6th grade, my first journal was a Taylor one during her Red era but it broke. I felt so bad that I stopped buying her CDs after Reputation. I can’t wait to see this masterpiece and to reminisce all the times Taylor has been an icon to me all of these years!;neu
chills;neu
Your voice is literally BEAUTIFUL;pos
I love your music;pos
I’m going to see it with my friends;neu

"Reputation taylor version is close.
Explanation:
Taylor is releasing albums every 112 Days
Karma music video: REPUTATION=February
112 Days= 4 Months
October(1989) - February(Reputation) = 4 months
June(Speak Now) - October(1989) = 4 Months
And Her albums were released after 112 days";neu
Queeeeeeen;neu
"You are going to release the documentary in Spain this year


I like you, Taylor, you are the best artist.";neu
I think the posts came at a wrong time ....OMG you have mistaken so many things ....but i can't tell now ....;neu

ATTENTION ALL SWIFTIES! If you are going to the tour movie since we will not have light up bracelets like at the concert we should all bring glow stick bracelets instead. Spread the word.;neu

Omg;neu
I didn't go. I'm crying.;neu
Taylor Swift? Yes!! But my spiritual baptism was at a Bruce Springsteen concert. It was during the song ‘No Surrender.’ It was during the line ‘I want to sleep/ beneath peaceful skies/ in my lover’s bed/ with the wide open country in my eyes/ and these romantic dreams in my head!’ I felt a powerful disc of energy inside my chest forcefully pushing out towards Bruce Springsteen on stage. Peace and Joy for Swifties!!;neu
"Taylor swift is 🔛 🔝 Who agrees?

13 for Taylorrr ❤";pos
WE ALL LOVE YOUUUUUUUU IM SOO EXCITED FOR YOU TO COME TO AUSTRALIA IM GOING TO SATURDAY NIGHT SHOW AT SYDNEYYY IM SOO EXCITED EVEN THO IM PRETTY YOUNG IT WILL BE A MEMORIE THAT STICKS WITH ME FOREVER!;neu

Why did you make your music unavailable in Russia? There’re millions of swifties who can’t not only come to your Eras tour but even listen to your new music 😢All we are left with is the old versions of your albums… Taylor’s version is unavailable… Can you make it available on YouTube? We’ve been supporting your for a decade, now you pretend we don’t exist! It’s unfair to us, your fans ((;neu

Whoever cut this trailer together did an amazing job, extremely well done and I haven't seen a quality of this type in many years.   This trailer grabs you by the hand and yanks you in flowing through the different cuts with music and scenes that were made for each other.  I'm greatly looking forward to seeing this in large format, traveling through time, and experiencing what looks like the up-close concert of a lifetime.;neu

McGrath just I love you;pos

As someone who couldn’t go to a live show and has avoided spoilers, this gives me chills, I cannot wait to see it on the big screen and then hopefully stream it at home and dance with my cat😂 I come back to watch this every few days. They did an amazing job on this trailer 10/13/23 will be one for the books!;neu

She might break records like a Marvel movie. Movie theater chains are suffering, so a billion dollar event like this is just what they needed with the ongoing writers strike and shaky income streams. I am just wondering how many Swifties are going to watch the movie multiple times? If that happens, it could perform like Titanic where it remained near the top every week.;neu
I can't wait to see this !!!;neu

It's me. Hi. The universe brought me here my name is Ulices. There's no way the video was put here 13 days ago this comment is new unplanned I want to learn from you;neu
My birthday it's October 13 ♡♡♡;neu
I'm a pretty casual fan being an old man and whatnot, but TS is truly a phenom and I feel like she is our Beatles, you know? That force which unites people and might be a bit too mainstream and smooth to be accepted by the snobs, but the fans sure get it. But comparisons are tough because TS seems like such a canny person, not cynical, but highly self aware and determined to control her image for the betterment of herself and the fandom. Anyway, looking forward to this.;neu
Please Continue to remind your fans to register to vote. We love you Taylor Swift!!❤;pos
🔥🔥🔥🔥;neg
❤❤❤;pos
Bring in India 🤧;neu
I wish I could go I probably will when I move out;neu

Show of the summer on vmas 🎉🎉;neu
I am in the humble position of a crown princess, I will need to serve at a military army academy.;neu
"Prophecies for the day of never, they consume you for decades. I am in the humble position of a crown princess, I will need to serve at a military army academy. You are my wedding bride, there is no way to escape the altar because you will be called up for mandatory military service for 4 years of organic purification for nuptials and pregnancy with an heir child with me.
Until when will I have to continue loved you with your photographs without the government procedure with Crown Prince prisoner on the bed in the room passionate with your delicious seductive photographs. I woke up in this photo and as we always I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and other organic needs on our bodies in the morning, to finally get through the routine of a day without any future plans, I'm always compose my themes with your eyes in this your hot face, but it would be much more true to have you in bed with me when I want you so with me. 
We are lost without a purpose because the lottery that comes with financial protection insists on keeping us in perpetual quarantine, in the praying at the altar for the resurrection of Christ, this does not validate any miracle, even with tragedies giving us support to take position, and In the end everything, we remain static like statues in the square. It would not be for this procedure that we exist in this activity of surveillance and control of a civilization as a prophet and guardian of this civilization, something needs to happen and everything is linked to lotteries, while we remain studying in control of research but with a curse making any progress impossible. I love you ""The Ptrince"" September 13, 2023 - 13:51 - Brasilia - Brazil";neu

Without a doubt it is the best musical show of the moment and one of the best in history. The new Queen of world pop is the best female artist of the last two decades. I don't want to exaggerate! but I really  the facts prove me right. 😇 💚TS 💚;neu
Will this concert film be shown in Russia?;neu
Lately when I hear your voice I don’t feel so lonely… hard years… and greatest hits volume 2 was my first cd… fanning since.. I don’t know Reba but when her voice hits it’s like hearing from a friend you never get to see but if you did it’s like no time passed between… thank you for sound tracking my life.. 🫶 the girl from New England… 😆 🫶✨✨✨;neu
Wow!!! Goosebumps!!! She made a history in music!! The queen!!!;neu

"I just got my braces and they were putting getaway car!!!!!!
It made me so much better listening to tatlor☺️";neu
So this film can be only seen in American theaters?What about other areas?😢;neu
Taylor swift is the most overrated artist of all time;neu
I'm paying attention to listen to some of y'all on music looking at the technical side of it like because of the understanding of digital and all the different rotations that play in design of music and understand of mathematical complexities of things how people download and upload and install and no one y'all were in sessions that have really loud things and they're jumping back and forth I'm noticing a huge change in the behavior complexity from artist from when they first start to later on in our life like something speed and some of y'all backwards or I don't know if it's the research chemicals and then it's alternate and the understanding of how y'all view life not just life your body's adaption to change I think some of y'all order go have some of y'all's equipment looked out;neu
Please Taylor. Do something with a band called the Black Crowes. It would make my world complete.;neu
All the swifities from India, they know the feeling.;neu
If it wasn't for the ticket prices I would have loved to see her live on this tour even without being a true fan. Just cos it's something extraordinary to tell your kids about when you're older.;neu
I love you sm taylor❤;pos

My prediction for reputation Taylor‘s version is that it will come out on New Year’s Day because the time between Taylor announcing speak now n Taylor‘s version and 1989 Taylor‘s version is the same time between 1989 announcement and New Year’s Day. and when she announced 1989 Taylor‘s version the second surprise song was New Year’s Day (off rep ofc) so that is my prediction;neu

Hey! If Taylor disagrees, I'll take this down with bowed head. But I hope all you people work of compassion, down in the clockwork of your hearts you may not understand even 30 years later. But, Follow your heart is the scariest, worst piece of advice i was ever given, but it's better than being guided by the media. My LOVE to every SINGLE ONE OF YOU!

International swifties crying in a corner😭😭😭😭;neg
Love Taylor Swift since the beginning. She is one who don't need desperate tactics to sell an album...just her being her authentic self and writing her own songs...love it. I think she is the rare performers who reach epic proportions that you can still bring different generations to the concerts. Literally the best.;neu
When the quality is better then your vision- 😭💀;neu
THIS WOMAN MUST NOT SLEEP, SHE ALWAYS WORKING;neu
People accusing her of having no talent whatsoever should just admit that Taylor is a creative genius who will never fail to surprise her fans and haters alike by continuing to be relevant and relatable even when big names tried to bring her down. Don't even get me started with her songwriting prowess and the showmanship she puts in her sold out concerts. I am grateful to live in a time of a great artist like her. With that being said, cant wait for 1️⃣9️⃣8️⃣9️⃣, the album that solidified my Swiftie heart.;neu
Mid;neu
😭😭 . I wanna be there so badly 😭😭.this is the coolest thing everrrr❤;neu

Masterful performer who really knows her fans and understands her product. Also, the swifties are really an impressive and lovable fanbase that made the experience really special. You guys rock!!;neu

One of the things I noticed they went up in a rocket or they tried but it didn't make it so when a lot of times when stuff like that happens there's opportunity around places to help him with the orchestrate repride themselves redevelop their growth even if it means somebody else is coming to help whether it be from the public side or whether it be from the military side just somebody to come make sure the area prospers which I mean they can do it their self but it's always nice to know it's something fun they're not everything's all work I'll just because you fail you're going to see yourself back at the end;neu
Somebody did say you was too tired I don't know why or they just jealous are you up for a challenge I mean since the military and everything didn't invite you;neu
They did say they hold one of the biggest arenas there was I'm not sure if your fans will be allowed there or not hint hint hint;neu
They got all kinds of opportunity back there The sisters been on the rise for a while;neu

As an international fan, I was HOPING that she would do something similar to the Reputation stadium tour, and I didn't expect that she would actually do something like that again. This and 1989 TV's release next month is too much for me, this woman is spoiling me;neu

"""El Señor no retarda su promesa (su regreso), según algunos la tienen por tardanza, sino que es paciente para con nosotros, no queriendo que ninguno perezca, sino que todos procedan al arrepentimiento. Pero el día del Señor vendrá como ladrón en la noche; en el cual los cielos pasarán con grande estruendo, y los elementos ardiendo serán deshechos, y la tierra y las obras que en ella hay serán quemadas."" 

Dile a Jesús en voz alta: Jesús, confieso que soy pecador. Yo creo que tú eres el hijo de Dios y que tú derramaste tu preciosa sangre en la cruz por mí. Perdona mis pecados. Limpia mi corazón de toda iniquidad. Te doy gracias por salvarme ahora. Amén. 

Lee la Biblia y ora a diario. Congrégate cada semana en una iglesia que predique la Palabra de Dios.
Cristo viene pronto!

I am unwell!!!!!!!!!!!! Couldn’t get tickets to the live concert so this is the closest best thing! 😍😍😍 THANK YOU TAYLOR!!!! 🤩;neu
My fav vid for the rest of the year!;neu
As an International Swiftie, I'm close to tears. Can't she put it on Netflix so I can watch it over and over again like I do with Miss Americana and Rep Tour? It's probably more complicated than I'm imagining it to be but, hey, she's Taylor. She can do anything. (Even if it doesn't make it on Netflix or Disney plus, I will find a way to watch it. I always do).;neu
❤❤❤;pos
ESPECTACULAR 😮😢🎉;neu
TAYLOR SWIFT ILY SO MUCH AND YOUR MY IDOL;neu
Let it be shown in Europe too;neu

omg i need to see this;neu
Los fan's de Taylor son lo suficientemente jóvenes para sentir y creer que ella es arte. Al resto del mundo solo nos da risa y por supuesto sabemos que ella representa la industria músical. Toda generacion necesita crearse un ídolo. Es una necesidad parecida a la sed. Ella es lo que millónes de jóvenes quisieran ser pero no pueden.;neu
"I can""t wait to experience it live in Paris 🥹 and maybe after that, we'll get the film 🤞💜💜💜";neu
GORGEOUS... but please don't forget Latam :c;pos

Kanye better;pos
omg I just relized i have the same b-day as taylor!!!;neu
I ALREADY SECURED TICKETS MOTHER, SHE STARTED A CULT BUT I LOVE IT👹👹👹👹👹;neu
Imagine trying to go to a normal movie, and when you walk in you hear all of this screaming singing. When you ask the worker what the commotion is they respond with “oh that’s just the swifties!” Also who is the company filming it? Is it the mouse or is it a different company entirely (I would ask if it’s Netflix but they usually just put Netflix originals like Miss American onto Netflix immediately). Will it ever go to streaming? Will they only bring up 2 of the secret songs, and if so which 2? There are so many questions and concerns I have about this experience, so I hope that some of them at least will be answered before chaos can ensue;neu
Off offf dərdimi kimə deyim kim anlayar axı 😫;neu
Taylor...we wish to see your shows in India 🥳;neu

We deserve this film more than America tbh
Don't we deserve just a glimpse";neu
"It's amazing how Taylor has been able to get to this point; remembering her incident with Kanye and he saying that she wasn't deserving of that award, but Beyonce was.

Be blessed, sister in spirit.";neu
"Nobody:How many times have you watched this?

Can’t wait to see 🥹🫶🏻❤️;neu
Fantastica;neu
Shame on you Taylor.  You have gone 180 degrees.  You were humble, honest, and all about music.  You have fallen to the capitalist demons, your music has become completely formulated, and the natural talent you had has been drained.  I was a huge fan about 10 years ago.  Now I think your garbage.;neu
This looks astonishing! Hope it gets to the streaming platforms after the theater.;neu
Thank you Taylor! Going with my mom who has never been to a concert and can’t now because of health issues. This is the closest thing to a true concert together that we’ll ever get and I’m SO incredibly thankful. It really means the world. We love you and can’t wait ❤❤❤;neu
IM SUPER HAPPY!! Taylor you are amazing and I can not wait to see you in theaters🩷;neu
"I'm a boy. 
I'm a Swiftie.

She's still going to be copied, because a lot of artists are doing it like Taylor. Era will be copied, two albums in the same year too, the videos she shows in full concert. She's so awesome that every other artist feels obligated to be like Taylor.;neu

She is my favorite queen ever. She slays and is still going after many months of tour. She had to memorize 3.5 hours of dancing, singing, and talking in front of millions of people all around the planet and she enjoys every second of it. I went in Pittsburgh and she just looked so happy throughout the whole thing. I love her and she is the best thing that’s ever been mine ❤❤❤;neu

Please Taylor it's not fair to let your international fans cry like this, you gotta release it all over the world coz who doesn't listens to you?!!???!? 😭💎;neu
MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT! When she first came on the Eras tour, I said to my family she's going to make it a film like she did with reputation and here we are 7 months later and I was correct;neu

I am SO pumped for this!  I've always liked her music, but seeing the Eras Tour in Massachusetts was a whole other thing and an experience like no other concert! I am now a real Swiftie! We had seats off to the side so although we were pretty close, we didn't get to see the visuals on the main stage.  Now, I get to see it ALL, know all the chants and every song fully, and enjoy it from a new perspective.  I can't flipping wait!;neu

I'm not Taylor Swift fan but I really enjoyed her concert on Netflix in UHD 4k and Atmos sound. It was better than the Beyonce Concert on Netflix because it had Atmos sound. I hope both Beyonce and Taylor Swift sell their concerts on UHD Blueray with Atmos sound. So those of us, who want to experience their concerts with the best picture and sound quality. That's you can't get from Streaming. So  all you fans please tell Taylor Swift to release this movie in UHD Blueray in 4k with HDR and Atmos sound, for those of us who want to see her in the best quality available!!!!;neu
Literallll chillls, i got goose bumps just like 2 seconds in, TS is AMAZING love her music sooo much ❤❤❤;pos

"I just got my tickets and I am SO stoked!!! I'm going on 10/31 and I'm wearing my ""A Lot Going On at The Moment"" shirt that she wears during the Red Era, a black fedora, black shorts, and I'll have a friendship bracelet or a few that say ""Lover"" and other things on them. As someone who tried during both pre-sales to get tickets, couldn't, watched livestreams of the whole show, but couldn't actually go, because TICKETMASTER, *cough* I feel like Taylor is doing her fans who couldn't come a real solid here with this release. I feel like it's her way of making things right not only with her fans because Ticketmaster screwed us over, but it's also very smart of her from a business sense. Tickets are already selling today and it was just announced in my area this morning. I don't care what anyone says, Swiftie for life here. Can't wait to see this!!!!! It's gonna be so loud and I hope everyone in that theatre is SCREAMING!!!!";neu

I wanna cry seeing this trailer! Taking my 7 year old baby girl to see it too! Taylor and I are the same age! I can’t believe how far she made it! She is stunning and amazing! I remember when I first heard her hit “Tim McGraw”. There was no one like her or her lyrics my age!! I knew from the moment I heard that song, she wouldn’t just go away, and would be so successful! Here she is! I remember when I first heard her cross over to pop. I wasn’t sure I’d like it. I was wrong. She can do anything. She’s still my role model. I’m a Swiftie for life. Love you Taylor! 🩷🎉 Congrats on all your success!;neu

"I wonder what will the chosen surprise songs be. If I'm guessing I'd say Our Song & YOYOK, but who knows... Taking into account this seems to be from the first 3 LA shows. She recorded, like... 6 of them right? Wait. Okay. Hear me out. I don't know if this could be doable or how to properly explain it, but what if... There's just not one edited, set in stone, set of surprise songs for the film, but instead all 6 are edited and 2 of them randomly chosen in every showing? Like, a theater in Mexico gets YOYOK and DBATC and a theater in Texas gets Maroon and Our Song. Or like, the 5pm showing gets ICS and YIL, and the 7pm gets DBATC and Maroon. That way no one 100% knows what songs they'll be getting and it somewhat keeps the ""surprise"" factor in. Would that be feasible or worth doing?";neu
Im so sad;neg
I just hope that there will be eras film here in the Philippines also;neu
It’s amazing. I just - I can’t find words. Taylor swift is a name that I will always and forever hold close to my heart. Go Taylor ! ❤;neu

I just bought my ticket for October 13 😭🩷 I can't wait!!!;neu
I wait for thissssssssssssssssssssssssss🤟;neu
Can someone help me with the songs that are gonna be on the film, please I need to know;neu
Needs to be a netflix show for us international swifties;neu
This is my crying 😢😢;neg
"I wonder what will the chosen surprise songs be. I think YOYOK will be one for sure, but who knows... Taking into account this seems to be from the first 3 LA shows. She recorded, like... 6 of them right? Wait. Okay. Hear me out. I don't know if this could be doable or how to properly explain it, but what if... There's just not one edited, set in stone, set of surprise songs for the film, but instead all 6 are edited and 2 of them randomly chosen in every screening? Like, a cinema in Mexico gets YOYOK and DBATC and a cinema in Texas gets Maroon and Our Song. Or like, the 5pm screening gets ICS and YIL, and the 7pm gets DBATC and Maroon. That way no one 100% knows what songs they'll be getting and it somewhat keeps the ""surprise"" factor in. Would that be feasible or worth doing?";neu
Dream come true;pos
Omg! Of course, she releases this today, 31 backward is 13...and my brother's birthday lol! I'm so excited for this!;neu
U are the best Singer in THE WORLD omg my mom love ur music;neu

i hope for the 1989 era, they switch camera angles every 2 seconds;neu
All I can think about is her saying in Miss Americana that she wanted to work really hard while society is still tolerating her being successful. LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED, MISS TAY. This is one of the biggest music tours in history and it's about your legacy, your life written in songs that thousands of women (and some men too) can relate to because it's part of our lives too. So thank you for all the hard work, we'll not let you fall behind. The Eras Tour is one industry-changing event, showbiz will not be the same after it.;neu
aaaaaa;neu
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;neu
Oh how I love being American;neu
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG;neu
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?;neu
252 days until #TSErasTourParis;neu
*cry in international swifitie* I LOVE YOU TAYLOR;neu
"If this isn't 5 hours long with the whole show + showcasing all the openers she had on the US leg and all the surprise guests and a little backstage magic, I'd still want it but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want the whole shibang! Any and all Taylor Swift is not a want but a need!

And Brazil???? 😢;neg
Chills. Can't wait ❤;neu
I’ve waited my entire life for this this! 😭😭;neu
Incomparable, unstoppable, unforgettable. Taylor Swift IS the music industry.;neu
Anybody notice she put self titled after 1989 but before midnights? I’m guessing this is a reference to the surprise songs but maybe debut Taylor’s version is after 1989 Taylor’s version?;neu
I'm already sobbing 😭;neg
Taylor Swift really is THE moment.;neu
Ahhhhhhh i love this;pos
Wait……. A movie?        Whatever happens I’m going;neu
Hará un concert film para cada país que visite🤔🤔🤔?   yen2 no, LLEGANDO.;neu

TAYLOR. ALISON. SWIFT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU DOGSLSHSLDHDOSU;neu
I’m going to Riverview 14 and I’ll be trading bracelets;neu
If i have kids, they will know of Mother. Like they would know of King of Pop.;neu
QUÉ;neu
Taylor I freaking love you;pos
The fact that the Cruel Summer is the one that featured in this trailer.;neu
thank you so much taylor for giving fans this movie experience before the tour's even halfway done because so many of us have missed out and had to watch on our phones lmao this trailer looks AMAZING. I only wish it had theatrical releases everywhere 😭 hoping it gets a digital release by early next year because I didn't manage to get tickets in my country and I'm so sad to be missing out but seeing the movie in high quality would be something special regardless <3;neu
IM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS;neu
TAYLOR SWIFT!!!! You aren't coming to India for your tour, atleast let your movie come to the theaters in Delhi NCR on October 13th, it's my birthday. I am your biggest fan. Please don't do this;neu
THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE YOU TAYLOR I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS IT COMES TWO DAYS BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY !!😭;neu
"First words-
-crying of happiness 
-screaming 
-throwing up 
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGG";neu
Sadly I couldn’t get tickets I’m so sad :( but I know it’s okay.;neu
I’m so excited!;pos
If someone could’ve told the 12 year old that was running into shops asking for record deals this is what she’d be doing now she’d be shocked;neu
Exciting but I'll wait for the Bluray release that'll no doubt come out some time later. That way I can watch at home, without all the movie theater singers drowning her out. I'm sure that would add to the experience but I'd rather just hear Taylor sing it lol. Wonder if this will be a 3+ hour movie like the shows were?;neu
I love you Taylor 💝;pos
The music industry is a person. LGB!!! (If you know, you know) ❤️;neu

I’m weeping;neg
Please release the movie in India;neu
She’s great and I wish nothing but the best for her, but some of you guys are overrating her by putting down other musicians to uplift her. There are other talented artists in music and many legends in the past that deserve their flowers as well.;neu
Please say this is coming to international theatres and/or Disney+;neu
And like, the media snippets also serve as an easter egg to rep. Help.;neu
Only in North America🙃;neu
"Rep is so the next album. WAIT ""READY FOR IT TV""????????????? AND YEAH SO REP";neu
I feel I won’t be able to scream to Cruel Summer at the theater 😂;neu
Guys my guess is that she is only doing North American cinemas because most international people haven’t experienced the tour yet…I’m sure she’ll release it later on.;neu
“self-titled” i gasped 💀;neu
LINDA MÃE;neu
Still in top of her game, you gotta respect that. 💯👑;neu

It makes me proud to know that, 50 years from now, future generations will want to know about her, or maybe it will be up to them to look up information or study about her life for school, but we had the amazing opportunity to wait for the new albums and re-recordings, the singles, her documentaries, her new videos and news, but most of all how she succeeds live!!! In conclusion, Taylor Swift is amazing... WE ARE SO LUCKYY;neu

ME MUERO;neu
¿pero qué es este spoiler para los none-USAmericans?!!;neu
"Literally, Taylor Swift, IS AN ICON! her voice is just >>>
One of my fav singers";neu
OMG WHAT I REALLY DIDNT EXPECT THIS;neu
"I see people say ""she can't release it worldwide or it will lessen the excitement for the international tour.""

I'd think what matters more with these decisions is money, and the entire tour is ~sold out globally, so no danger of losing out on tour ticket sales.

No one seems to worry the SECOND NA leg is ruined because some will have already seen the film.

I'd guess it's only NA because either 1) timed exclusivity 2) they haven't finalized international distribution deals yet, or 3) they think there's not enough demand (what)
EDIT: 4) they might even make another one of an international show.

Besides, a huge % of tour goers will have seen videos/streams already, especially international, where we couldn't trust that the tour will ever come to us. :p
We're still excited, trust me.";neu
Taylor's one of the most brilliant artists right now. Can't believe it's been 17 yrs 🎉👏👏👏;neu
my sister went to the eras tour without me and I cried for like two weeks.;neu
"Taylor swift, the music industry...
I cant go to the eras tour because of where i live, but i watched it on youtube multiple times and i just admire how talented she is.
This trailer made me cry, cuz i know that ill probably never be able to watch the movie for the same reason i cant see her live..

As someone that is about to turn 50, i think Taylor Swift is amazing and a great inspiration to woman all around the world.  I see the videos of all these people so thrilled to see her at the Eras Tour and it makes me so happy for them! Lifetime memories🎉❤;neu
But what about the other countries??😭😭;neu
"Sis got me fighting mini Great Wars in my robe at 9am! Come on TayTay! 😂

Taylor Swift best singer in this world, I listens to her song, since I was two years old. She is literally my childhood and my favourite singer now a days I wish I could go to her concert, but sadly I cannot because I am not from America.;neu
Pretty sure nobody is going to convince her to go to unknown countries for example kurdistan and others lol;neu

I am happy that she's been so successful because she gives back so much in passion and money to the people who help her. But this is not the Taylor Swift with whom I am obsessed. The concert I would go to is just her and me, her playing songs and me just listening. No big lights or microphones. I tear up just imagining it.;neu

This is probably only released in North America because she’s finished the North American leg (at least the first leg🤷🏻‍♀️) of her tour. 
The concert film will probably be released everywhere else once the tour is finished or she’ll release it as she finishes each leg of her tour🤷🏻‍♀️

THIS!!! Is why Taylor is and will always be a music legend bc she always think outside the box to find ways thr entire world gets to see and hear her ERAS TOUR She always thinks of her fans ensuring that whoever couldn't see a live performance can now see her performance in theater! It's obviously not like seeing her live, but the next best thing is recording her live on her tour and putting it in theaters!  Brilliant Taylor, and I can't wait to go see it!  Her music is inspirational, and from her heart and soul ❤🎼🎵🎶🎶🎵🎼;neu
