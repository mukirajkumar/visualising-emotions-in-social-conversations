Trump was only able to get 54% of the republican vote ,so yeah he won but not by much! 7 out of 10 Nikki Haley voters said they will never vote for trump and that’s republicans saying that,not democrats, and Joe Biden crushed the primary as a write in, so while donny has won in the primary and the caucus it’s not by a lot which is pretty pitiful and since he continues to attack any conservative voter who isn’t a loyal MAGA fascist he’s an incredibly weak candidate for the general election against Biden, and he will lose unless he cheats like in 2016 or tries another violent insurrection coup attempt.;0.8196448;0.16205761;0.018297669

"TRUMP'S = HATRED & JEALOUSY = 2024 !!
Hatred has plagued man since we wore skins of fur
Beating our enemies with stick and stone.
History has proven what we refuse to learn
As the seeds of hate by dispute are sown.

It's a fact, hate has been caused by religion
Or by those of different pigment of skin.
It's also a fact it's mostly jealousy
Mixed with the stupidity of sin.

If hatred consumes you refuse it control
For only then can you begin to live.
We don't have to remain wicked and spiteful
We just have to be willing to forgive.

Our riches can certainly grow their own wings
Though it's love that keeps us happy not things.
When we become rich beyond our wildest dreams
That's when hate always pursues us it seems.

It's concerning and amusing at the same time seeing how well Trump has completely fooled his supporters into thinking he actually wants to buck the system.  He is a very good con-man, he understand human psychology.  He knows exactly what his base wants to hear and he gives that to them - words.  Everyone knows no republican has any chance to beat Trump in the primaries, and yet here they are basking and gloating in their victory.  When your choice is between two different parties running the same game on the population, you come to realize you actually have no choice at all...

President Trump sounded petty and while he may be ahead now, but he is going to need a mix of voters who are not typical Trump voters.  Many women don’t like Trump because of this exact thing.  Following his comments both Kelly Ann Conway and Shawn Hannity said he missed an opportunity to run against Biden.  In fact, Trump elevated Gov Nikki by his rude and unnecessary comments.  I still am not convinced that the DNC will select Biden as their comment.  They always play the long game.  It is not inconceivable that at the last minute they will pick Michelle Obama “when they go low we go high”, and Trump will lose.  We cannot afford to have that happen!  I agree with Trump when he says if we lose, we are going to lose our country.  Every time he does great, he shoots himself in the foot.  Stop now!  Mr President, they HAVE weaponized the enforcement agencies and the courts, and the way you have been harassed throughout your presidency is abominable.  Don’t let them win now.  Be presidential!  Statesmen and Christians don’t act the way you did tonight.  This behavior is beneath you.  Thank you for being brave, for your fortitude in the face of overwhelming odds against you personally.

"Judge in E. Jean Carroll Case: Yes, Donald Trump Is a Rapist
A judge rejected Trump’s semantic attempt to throw out the case.
On Wednesday, Trump’s request for a new trial in the E. Jean Carroll case, after he was found liable for sexual abuse, battery, and defamation, was rejected. And in his desperate attempt to avoid accountability, the twice-impeached and twice-indicted former president may have unintentionally allowed himself to now be formally known as a rapist.
Trump’s team had requested a new trial in the case, arguing that the $5 million in damages he was ordered to pay Carroll was excessive, because he was only charged with sexual abuse. The jury had not found that Trump “raped” Carroll, a talking point Trump’s team often parroted.
But Judge Lewis Kaplan called Trump’s semantic argument “entirely unpersuasive.” He clarified that the jury found that the former president did indeed “rape” Carroll based on the common definition of the word.
Kaplan noted that New York penal law (the jury in the Carroll case was based in New York) has a “far narrower” definition of the word “rape” than in “common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere.”
“The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’” Kaplan wrote.
“Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that [rape, as ‘commonly’ understood].”
“A United States District Judge has now formally held, in a lengthy written opinion, that it is perfectly appropriate, and, indeed, entirely accurate, to call a certain former President of the United States a rapist,” noted George Conway, lawyer and husband to former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway.
All that to say, based on the legal language, a rapist—for the third presidential cycle in a row—is leading the 2024 Republican primary.

Can you imagine having a President that took NO salary, put ALL American Citizens First, ran the country like a business instead of a party while increasing EVERYBODY'S spendable income and lifestyle, making us energy independent at a cheap price. Also increasingly making the country more safe with a stronger military, bringing back Manufacturing, and increasing the border security on a daily basis. Using his own plane, not taxpayers, which he acquired running his own successful businesses not government grants while providing thousands of American jobs. Playing golf at his own resorts at his own expense with his own money, not taxpayers. And during his FIRST hole at playing golf accomplishes more Making America Great Again then the Democrats have done in the past 100 years. Now go enjoy your trip to the gas station and grocery store this week while you're paying your utilities. WHILE you're out there be sure and talk to other American Citizens about how great things are now with Biden and the Democrats.;0.029359343;0.26255888;0.7080818
